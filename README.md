# A beautifier for MATLAB files.

This beautifier is quite opinionated and does not offer many options. It
formats code to 4 spaces and aligns matrices cells. It lets you chose if you
want spaces around all operators or only around addition/subtraction. For now
(and possibly forever) that's all the options you have.
